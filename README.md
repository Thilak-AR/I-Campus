🚀 I‑Campus – Next‑Gen Smart Campus Management System
Overview I‑Campus is a multi‑tenant, AI‑ready, IoT‑enabled campus operating system that automates the complete student lifecycle from admission to placement. It supports multi‑branch institutions with strict role‑based access control and minimal manual intervention. Designed for web, mobile, and desktop frontends, the platform is built to remain relevant for the next 10–20 years.

✨ Key Highlights
End‑to‑end automation: Admissions, academics, attendance, exams, fees, hostel, transport, canteen, library, placement, alumni, audit, and more.

Multi‑tenant & multi‑branch: Institutions as tenants, campuses as branches; all data scoped by tenant + campus.

24+ role‑based dashboards: Super Admin, Principal, Faculty, Student, Parent, HR, Accounts, Hostel, Canteen, Transport, Library, Placement, Security, Audit, R&D, etc.

Hardware integration: RFID at gates, hostel, canteen, buses, library; biometric at classrooms; mobile QR as low‑cost alternative.

AI & analytics ready: Per‑role dashboards with KPIs, charts, alerts; planned AI assistant for queries like “show my attendance” or “next exam date.”

🏛 Current Backend Stack
Language: Python 3.13

Framework: FastAPI

Database: SQL Server (SQLAlchemy + pyodbc)

Auth: JWT (OAuth2 Password flow with python‑jose)

ORM: SQLAlchemy

Migrations: Alembic (planned)

🔧 Implemented Features
Project structure: Modular backend service with core, db, schemas, api, and services.

Multi‑tenancy base: Tenant, Campus, User, and Role models with scoped data.

Security & auth: Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT token generation, role‑based route protection.

Working APIs:

Auth: Login with JWT issuance.

Tenants: Create, list, soft delete (Super Admin only).

Campuses: Create/list campuses.

Users: Basic create/list endpoints with role checks.

Health: /health and /db-check.

🧩 Planned Major Features (Roadmap Snapshot)
Admission Management: End‑to‑end workflow with auto‑generated student IDs, emails, and default credentials.

Advanced Exam System: Online/offline exam schema, question banks, grading, revaluation, blockchain‑backed certificates.

Smart Attendance: RFID + biometric tracking, latecomer rules, unauthorized exit detection.

Canteen, Hostel, Library, Transport: RFID/bio‑based access, billing, automatic fee ledger updates.

Dashboards & Analytics: Role‑specific KPIs, MIS reports, audit logs, AI insights.

Company Admin / SaaS Onboarding: Tenant registration, verification, auto‑provisioning, platform‑wide monitoring.
